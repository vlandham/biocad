Objectives:
1 - integrate bing's code
2 - preprocess input microarray files 
3 - post process result file
4 - start go visualization
5 - continue gene group visualization

1 -
	x need to figure out how to compile his code
	x where to put the source files and executable
	 - source: app/matlab/microarray
	 - executable: lib/microarray
	* write rake task to automate this compilation process.
	
x2 - 
	x setup variants of the input files as paperclip settings (like thumbnails is) ?
	x figure out how to preprocess: 
	 - need to remove first row and first column - but keep them in separate files.
	 - write a method in microarray that modifies these files - retains all file paths
	
x3 - 
	x setup the output file as another paperclip attachement
	x parse results from bing's program
	x display the results on some screen
	
4 - 
	x read gorilla paper
	* attempt to download source of go information
	* try out using flare or graphviz for the visualization
	
5 - 
	* need to develop a gene group class
	* use this in all visualization processing
	* determine where various graphs should go
	 - current thought: just make non-restful methods for all variants under 'visualization' controller
	 - or we could have the 'show' in gene_group be the visualization action - and the particular visualization would be determined by a type parameter.
